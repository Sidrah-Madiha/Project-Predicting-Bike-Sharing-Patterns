# Project: Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns
Neural Network developed during my Deep Learning Fundamentals Nanodegree .
In this project, I created a simple neural network to use it to predict daily bike rental ridership.

###  Prerequisites
Thinks you have to install or installed on your working machine:

```Python 3.7
Numpy (win-64 v1.15.4)
Pandas (win-64 v0.23.4)
Matplotlib (win-64 v3.0.2)
Jupyter Notebook
Torchvision (win-64 v0.2.1)
PyTorch (win-64 v0.4.1)
Environment:
Miniconda or Anaconda```

### Installing
Use the package manager pip or miniconda or Anaconda to install your packages.
A step by step guide to install the all necessary components in Anaconda for a Windows-64 System:

```conda install -c conda-forge numpy
conda install -c conda-forge pandas
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
pip install torchvision
conda install -c pytorch pytorch
Jupyter Notebook
Your_first_neural_network.ipynb```
This jupyter notebook describe the whole project from udacity, from the beginning to the end.

### Running the project
The whole project is located in the jupyter notebook file `Your_first_neural_network.ipynb` and it's include the training an the prediction part. The neural network is implemented in the file my_answer.py and used from the jupyter notebook.
